# 🏦 Cops & Robbers Heist Simulator 🚔
About the Project
This is a cops and robbers simulation where you decide whether to rob a bank or be a good person and avoid crime. The outcome depends on the number of robbers vs. cops on duty!

## How It Works
- Set true or false in **runProgram(value)**
- true → Start the heist! Try to get away with the money.
- false → Be a good citizen and relax instead.
## Outcomes
- If robbers outnumber cops → You win and escape with cash! (Clicking "OK" takes you to a surprise video.)
- If cops outnumber robbers → You lose and go to jail.
## How to Play
- Open the JavaScript file.
- Find runProgram(false); at the bottom.
- Change false to true if you want to attempt a heist.
- Run the script and see what happens!
