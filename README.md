# 🏦 Cops & Robbers Heist Simulator 🚔
About the Project
This is a cops and robbers simulation where you decide whether to rob a bank or be a good person and avoid crime. The outcome depends on the number of robbers vs. cops on duty!

## How It Works
- Set true or false in **runProgram(value)**
- true → Start the heist! Try to get away with the money.
- false → Be a good citizen and relax instead.
## Outcomes
- If robbers outnumber cops → You win and escape with cash! 
- If cops outnumber robbers → You lose and go to jail.
## How to Play
- Open the JavaScript file.
- Find runProgram(false); at the bottom.
- Change false to true if you want to attempt a heist.
- Run the script and see what happens! (make sure the script is linked to html if applicable)

how long can your crime spree last???

### Thank you Shay for giving me this project it was super fun to make

ps. might add on to this if im ever bored like a system to track how much money you have collected maybe a bond system so you can avoid jail and try again and if im crazy ill jsut make it a full fledge game with shops etc
